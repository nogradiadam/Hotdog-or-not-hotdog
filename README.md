# Hotdog or not hotdog

## Simple machine learning app using CoreML, Inception v3 and Vision to recognise hotdogs

Master branch contains implementation using CoreML. Watson branch contains an alternative implementation using IBM Bluemix (Watson)

To add the Inception v3 model, [download it from Apple](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/coreml/models/Inceptionv3.mlmodel) and add it to the project directory.

This project was created as part of my Udemy course [iOS 12 & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/ios-12-app-development-bootcamp/)

It wasn't created for commercial purposes so please don't use it for such goals either.
